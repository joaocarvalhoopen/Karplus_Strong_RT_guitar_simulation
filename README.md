# Karplus Strong RT guitar simulation

This Pyhton 3.5 program is a real-time implementation of simultaneous 4 string guitar simulation with the algorithm of Karplus Strong. 

This program uses PyAudio lib and NumPy.

In Windows I used the Anaconda 3.5 distribution, see PyAudio page to learn how to install PyAudio.

For Karplus-Strong details see the paper:
